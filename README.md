# TensorFlow and TensorBoard with Network Evaluation

Purpose
The purpose of this lab is twofold.

to review using TensorFlow for modeling and evaluation with neural networks.
to learn about TensorBoard

TensorBoard is TensorFlow's visualization toolkit, so it is a dashboard that provides visualization and tooling that is needed for machine learning experimentation.
